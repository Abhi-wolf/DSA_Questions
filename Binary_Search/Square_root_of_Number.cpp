    Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer.
    The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

/*
    Base cases for the given problem are when the given number is 0 or 1, then return X;
    Create some variables, for storing the lower bound say l = 0, and for upper bound r = X / 2 (i.e, The
        floor of the square root of x cannot be more than x/2 when x > 1).
    Run a loop until l <= r, the search space vanishes
    Check if the square of mid or X/mid (mid = (l + r)/2 ) is less than or equal to X, If yes then search for a
        larger value in the second half of the search space, i.e l = mid + 1, update ans = mid
    Else if the square of mid or X/mid is more than X then search for a smaller value in the first half of the
         search space, i.e r = mid â€“ 1
    Finally, Return the ans
